# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-using-python
Vehicle number plate detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and extracting the license plate from a vehicle image. It uses image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to identify the number plate region and read the alphanumeric characters on it.

Technologies & Libraries Used:
Python
OpenCV – for image processing and contour detection.
Tesseract OCR / EasyOCR – for recognizing characters from the number plate.
NumPy – for array and image matrix operations.
Matplotlib – for displaying image outputs (optional).
